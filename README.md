Simple plugin that adds Twitter Cards functionality to Mura CMS.

Has support for all 'Page' content types, creating a 'summary' or 'summary_large_image' depending on associated image dimensions, or for a 'Gallery' content type, it creates a 'gallery' type card using the first 4 images from that gallery.

Do what you want with it, it's free, it's open source :)
